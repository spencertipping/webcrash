Want to learn JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and HTML5 so you can create cutting-edge web applications and stunning websites? Then this is the meetup for you!

In this special, one-time-only, highly concentrated, day-long meetup, you'll learn the ins & outs of everything you need to jump right into "Web 3.0" programming.

At the end of the day, you'll know enough about CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and browser quirks to develop flashy AJAX applications that work across browsers and across domains.
